EE4-68 Pattern Recognition CW2

In this coursework, we are solving the person reidentification problem using distance metric learning. The
idea of person re-identification is to retrieve images containing the same person from gallery to the query set[9].
Generally, the metric learning algorithms include unsupervised learning such as PCA, KPCA, and supervised learning
like Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (LMNN), Neighborhood Components Analysis (NCA) and Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis (LFDA). Both methods can transform the dataset to a new space, which aims to bring similar features closer; following by K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and
Nearest Neighbour (NN) algorithms we can find the accuracy of the re-identification algorithm. In this coursework, we implement several metric learning algorithms and they will be explained in the following sections.

• Our source codes are in both Jupyter notebook (*.ipytb) and Python (*.py) format

• File name indicates which methods that we used, for example: ”baseline.ipytb” and ”baseline.py” are the source code for the baseline method; "kpca rbf.ipytb" and "kpca rbf.py" are the KPCA methods using RBF kernel.

• If open Jupyter Notebook file, simply click run in the Notebook. If use .py file, compile and run the file in the compiler/editor.

• For a better visualization, we recommend using Jupyter Notebook to open the source code, since the python file is the converted version of the Jupyter Notebook file.
